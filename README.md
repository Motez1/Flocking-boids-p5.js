# Flocking-boids-p5.js
a simulation of flocking behavior of birds.

# How to use it ?
there are 4 main sliders which control the parameters of the simulation :

  1- Alignment : change the aptitude of the boid to steer twards the direction of steering the nearest 
     flock of boids
     
  2- Cohesion : change the aptitude of the boid to steer twards the direction of the center of the nearest
     flock of boids
  
  3- Separation : change the aptitude of the boid to steer away from the other boids
  
  4- Sensitivity: change the sensitivity of the parameters to the nearest boids , if max then each boid 
     is sensitive to all the other boids
